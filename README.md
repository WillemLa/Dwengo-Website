## dwengo web page

The dwengo web page is a static website generated by jekyll. 

### Install

To install jekyl follow the instructions on [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 

To locally generate the website and run it on a test server use the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

from the project root.

### Translation

All pages should be translated into dutch, french, german, and English. Translation key-value pairs are defined in yaml. Translation files are found in the folder /_i18n (ex. /_i18n/fr.yml). Content written in markdown or html can be translated using the following liquid tags:

```ruby
{% t translation_key_from_yaml %}
```

For translation examples, look in the index.markdown file.

### Adding a new page

To add a new page, four steps are required:

1. Create a markdown file in the project root.
2. Add page metadata to the file and make sure to specify layout, title, and permalink (ex. projects.md).
3. Add title translation key-value pairs to the translation yaml file for each language. Use the title value as key.
4. Add a reference to the new file in the _config.yml file under the header_pages object. This will show a link to the page in the menu.

### Style

- Use bootstrap as much as possible and make sure the website is mobile responsive.
- Additional style elements can be added to the /_sass/minima.scss file.
