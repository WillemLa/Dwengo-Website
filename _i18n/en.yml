  changing_the_future_body: Dwengo builds international networks and organises teaching activities in the world. By international activities we achieve worldwide collaboration between students and teachers in the field of computer science and robotics. Through experience we found that education in social-disadvantaged countries has other needs and different challenges than those in Western countries. By working together with local partners, we are able overcome these challenges to achieve our goals. Our goal is to plant seeds and provide the necessary nutrients by working locally to make the growth of a global network viable.

By means of online tutorials, support and hands-on workshops, Dwengo started to reach out for schools in Belgium. Nowadays, Dwengo has internationally expanded its activities and wants to reach out for everyone on the globe, in particular to social-economical disadvantaged regions where technology cannot be accessed easily. To do this, Dwengo tries to help already existing local communities by offering them knowledge and expertise.
